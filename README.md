## Javascript Timezone Abbreviation Map

 - maps from timezone offsets to common timezone abbreviations
 - shows different values based on Daylight Savings Time
  - during standard time, -7:00 shows MST, -8:00 shows PST
  - during daylight savings time, -7:00 shows PDT

### Contributing

I chose what seemed like they would be well known time zone abbreviations for each zone.  If you live in a zone and the abbreviation isn't obvious, let us know and it can be updated.
